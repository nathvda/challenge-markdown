## You can always count on me when
If you ever doubt yourself or need help with something you don't quite understand, don't be afraid to come to me and ask. I won't judge you, and I will try my best to help. 

I'm also good at organizing and trying to find solutions when something looks like it's stuck. It's never really stuck, but sometimes, having an outlook from someone else can be of great help. 

If you need somewhat of a listening ear, I'll be there too, it doesn't need to be related to work. The goal is to help you feel better.  

Also, I can bring jokes, I love puns.

## A funny story
When I was younger, I used to make spectacles for my parents and I always asked them to come to the playroom and watch me as and danced and sung. It was one of the best moments of my life. As we went on holiday with my parents, there was that party you could go to and participate in a performance, so I was obviously very happy to do so. The unfortunate thing was that as soon as I approached the stage, I fell in front of the audience and they were so scared I got hurt that I got a free t-shirt ! It's very funny, when I think about it.

### TL;DR
I had to go on stage and fell in front of the whole audience.
